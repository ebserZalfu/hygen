# Gold Rush: The Game - Parker's Edition: A Review
 
Gold Rush: The Game - Parker's Edition is a bundle that includes the base game and two DLCs: Collector's Edition Upgrade and Frankenstein Machinery. The game is a realistic simulation of gold mining, where you can work hard, dig deep, explore the world, and become the wealthiest person in Alaska. You can use a variety of specialist machines to find as much gold as you can, such as excavators, wash plants, shakers, trommels, and more. You can also customize your mining site with workers, vehicles, and equipment.
 
The game is based on the popular TV show Gold Rush, and features Parker Schnabel as a mentor who guides you through the seasons. You can follow his career from the very beginning or create your own story. You can also compete with other players in leaderboards and achievements. The game has realistic graphics, physics, and sounds that immerse you in the gold mining experience.

The game has mostly positive reviews on Steam[^2^], with many players praising its realism, depth, and fun factor. Some of the negative reviews mention bugs, glitches, and performance issues that affect the gameplay. The developers are constantly updating and improving the game with new features and fixes.
 
However, some players may be tempted to download a cracked version of the game from illegal sources, such as torrent sites or forums. This is not only unethical and illegal, but also risky and harmful. Cracked games may contain viruses, malware, or spyware that can damage your computer or steal your personal information. They may also have missing or corrupted files that prevent the game from running properly or at all. Moreover, cracked games cannot access online features such as multiplayer, leaderboards, achievements, or updates.
 
Therefore, we strongly recommend that you buy Gold Rush: The Game - Parker's Edition from the official Steam store[^1^], where you can get it for a discounted price of $31.47. This way, you can support the developers who worked hard to create this game, and enjoy it to the fullest without any risks or problems.

## How to Play Gold Rush: The Game - Parker's Edition
 
If you are interested in playing Gold Rush: The Game - Parker's Edition, here are some tips and tricks to help you get started.
 
- First, you need to choose a difficulty level. There are four options: Easy, Normal, Hard, and Expert. Each one affects the amount of money you start with, the prices of machines and fuel, the amount of gold in the ground, and the weather conditions. Choose the one that suits your skill and preference.
- Next, you need to choose a game mode. There are two options: Campaign and Free Play. Campaign mode follows Parker's career from season 2 to season 8 of the TV show, with different goals and challenges for each season. Free Play mode lets you create your own story and play at your own pace.
- Then, you need to choose a mining site. There are four locations available: Old Arnold Parcel, Pine Valley Parcel, Rivertown Parcel, and Nighthawk Parcel. Each one has different terrain, resources, and potential. You can also buy or rent new parcels as you progress in the game.
- After that, you need to buy or rent some machines and equipment. You can find them in the warehouse or the shop. You can also upgrade or repair them as needed. You will need an excavator to dig the dirt, a loader to transport it, a wash plant to process it, and a gold table to collect the gold. You will also need a generator to power your machines, a fuel tank to refuel them, a water pump to supply water to your wash plant, and a magnetite separator to separate the magnetite from the gold.
- Finally, you need to start mining. You can use the map to find the best spots to dig. You can also use the drill machine to scan the ground and see the gold content. You can switch between different machines using the TAB key or the mouse wheel. You can also hire workers to help you with various tasks, such as driving, repairing, or loading.

As you mine, you will earn money and experience points. You can use the money to buy or rent new machines and equipment, pay your workers and bills, or upgrade your mining site. You can use the experience points to unlock new skills and perks that improve your mining efficiency and profitability.
 
You can also participate in various events and challenges that occur randomly or periodically in the game. For example, you can join a competition with other miners to see who can find the most gold in a given time, or you can face a breakdown or a storm that affects your mining operation.
