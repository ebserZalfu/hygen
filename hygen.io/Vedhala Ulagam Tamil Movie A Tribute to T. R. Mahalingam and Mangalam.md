The film begins with Rajasimhan, a young prince, who is bored of his life in the palace. He spends his time with his loyal friend Dhathan, who entertains him with his jokes and stories. One day, Rajasimhan discovers a book in his mother's puja room that contains the secrets of Vedhala Ulagam, a mysterious land of demons and magic. He is intrigued by the book and decides to read it.
 
He learns that Vedhala Ulagam is ruled by a cruel demon king, who has imprisoned many men who failed to complete his three impossible tasks. The king also has a beautiful daughter, Rajeevi, who is kind and compassionate. Rajasimhan is captivated by her picture in the book and wishes to meet her. He also finds out that his father, who disappeared 18 years ago, was one of the prisoners in Vedhala Ulagam.
 
Rajasimhan decides to go to Vedhala Ulagam to rescue his father and win Rajeevi's hand. He convinces Dhathan to accompany him and they set out on their adventurous journey. They reach Vedhala Ulagam and are greeted by a group of demons led by Kulathu Mani, who take them to the king's court. There, they meet Rajeevi, who recognizes Rajasimhan as her true love from a dream.
 
The demon king challenges Rajasimhan to complete his three tasks if he wants to free his father and marry Rajeevi. The tasks are: 1) To bring back a golden apple from a garden guarded by a ferocious dragon; 2) To defeat a powerful wrestler named Mahendran; and 3) To answer three riddles posed by the king himself. Rajasimhan accepts the challenge and sets out to accomplish them.
  
With the help of Rajeevi and a friendly demon named Kannan, Rajasimhan manages to complete the first two tasks. He brings back the golden apple from the dragon's garden and defeats Mahendran in a wrestling match. However, he faces a tough challenge in the third task, as the demon king asks him three riddles that test his intelligence and morality.
 
The first riddle is: What is the most precious thing in the world? Rajasimhan answers: Love. The second riddle is: What is the most dangerous thing in the world? Rajasimhan answers: Hatred. The third riddle is: What is the most foolish thing in the world? Rajasimhan answers: Sacrificing one's life for another.
 
The demon king is impressed by Rajasimhan's answers, but he reveals that he has a trick up his sleeve. He tells Rajasimhan that he has to prove his answer to the third riddle by sacrificing his life for Rajeevi. He shows him a sword and a fire pit and asks him to choose one. Rajasimhan chooses the fire pit and jumps into it, holding Rajeevi in his arms.
 
However, instead of burning to death, Rajasimhan and Rajeevi find themselves in a heavenly realm, where they are greeted by Goddess Kali. She tells them that she was pleased by their courage and devotion and that she has blessed them with eternal happiness. She also tells them that she has freed all the prisoners from Vedhala Ulagam, including Rajasimhan's father.
 
Rajasimhan and Rajeevi are overjoyed and thank the goddess. They return to their kingdom with their father and Dhathan. They are welcomed by their mother and the people with great joy and celebration. The film ends with Rajasimhan and Rajeevi getting married and living happily ever after.
