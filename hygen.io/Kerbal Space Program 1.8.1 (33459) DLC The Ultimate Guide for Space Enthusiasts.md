That's where the DLCs come in. DLC stands for downloadable content, which means extra features or items that you can add to your game for a small fee. Kerbal Space Program has two official DLCs: Making History and Breaking Ground. These DLCs add new parts, missions, planets and features to the game, making it more fun and diverse.

- New engines, fuel tanks, command pods, landing gears, wings and more.
- New planets and moons to explore, such as Duna's moon Ike, Jool's moon Laythe and Eeloo's moon Pol.
- New soundtracks and sound effects for your spacecraft and environments.
- New skins and decals for your spacecraft and Kerbals.
