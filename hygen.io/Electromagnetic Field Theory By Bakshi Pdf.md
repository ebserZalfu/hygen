## What is Electromagnetic Field Theory?
  
Electromagnetic field theory is the study of how electric charges and currents produce electric and magnetic fields, and how these fields interact with each other and with matter. Electromagnetic field theory is based on four fundamental equations known as **Maxwell's equations**, which describe how electric and magnetic fields are generated and modified by each other and by electric charges and currents.
  
Electromagnetic field theory has many applications in engineering and science, such as:
  
- Electronics: designing circuits, devices and systems that use electric currents and voltages.
- Communication: transmitting and receiving information using electromagnetic waves such as radio, TV, mobile phones, etc.
- Power systems: generating, transmitting and distributing electric power using transformers, generators, transmission lines, etc.
- Aerospace: designing and operating aircrafts, satellites, rockets, etc. that use electromagnetic propulsion, navigation, communication, etc.
- Biomedical: understanding and manipulating biological processes using electric and magnetic fields such as MRI, pacemakers, etc.
- Nanotechnology: creating and manipulating materials and structures at the nanoscale using electric and magnetic forces.
